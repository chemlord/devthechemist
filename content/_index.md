        I'm Devraj Bagchi and I'm a Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Honours student at Trent University. My academic interests lie deeply in Synthetic Organic Chemistry, specifically Carbonyl chemistry, which I explore both theoretically and through sample analysis via analytical instrumentation and data documentation critical for high-standard research.

        As a hobby, I've also developed skills in front-end web development and UI design, learning languages such as Go, HTML, CSS, and Python, which I enjoy applying to create and manage my own academic portfolio.

        **Specialties:** My Laboratory proficiencies include but are not limited to TLC, FT-IR, Â¹H NMR, GC-MS, HPLC, IEC, SEC, and UV-Vis spectroscopy, biohazard handling, aspetic technique, etc.
